## Fall 2022

**Section 1 (online synchronous): Networks, Software, and Systems**

**Section 2 (online synchronous): Human Factors, Law, and Policy**

**Both sections meet on Zoom at N hour (W 3:00pm—5:30pm). Attendance is required.**

## Welcome

This **online synchronous course** explores advanced topics and highlights current research in computer security and privacy. Recent research papers will be presented and discussed. Also, projects will provide an opportunity for creative work. Class attendance is required and active participation in class discussions is essential. The course has two sections, each with a different focus and prerequisites. Instructor permission is required to register. The course can be used toward satisfying the capstone requirement for the ScB degree in Computer Science.

**Section 1 (Networks, Software, and Systems)** addresses computer security and privacy from the perspective of networks, software, and systems. Topics include applications security, applied cryptography, cloud security, operating systems security, software security, web security, and vulnerabilities and defenses in cyber physical systems (e.g., automotive, medical, and industrial control devices).  For this section, **CSCI 1660 or equivalent background is a prerequisite**.

**Section 2 (Human Factors, Law, and Policy)** addresses computer security and privacy from the perspective of law, policy, and human factors. Topics include cyber crime, personal data protection regulation, internet governance, cyber security norms and standards, threat modelling, cyber incident response, and usable security.  For this section, **one of CSCI 1360, 1800, 1805, 1860, or 1880, or equivalent background, is a prerequisite**. 

In Fall 2022, both sections of the course are offered in **online synchronous format over Zoom at N hour (W 3:00pm—5:30pm)**.

**Instructor permission is required to register for the course.**

The course can be used toward satisfying the
[capstone requirement](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/concentrating-in-cs/concentration-requirements/capstone/) for the ScB degree in Computer Science.

### Online Resources

This page serves as course syllabus and public website.  A private website with additional resources for registered students will be created.

This  [Canvas website](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1083171),
accessible only by registered students, contains detailed course
information and materials, and is used to submit the deliverables for
the topic presentation and project.

## Learning Activities and Workload

The work for the course comprises a topic presentation, a project, and participating in class discussions.

### Topic Presentation

A topic presentation consists of studying in depth and presenting a recent research paper from a leading venue (journal or conference) in computer security and privacy. The presentation should include background material related to the paper so it can be understood by everyone in the class. A set of slides in Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint format should be submitted ahead of the presentation. A final version of the slides that incorporates feedback from the instructor and the class discussion should be submitted after the presentation.

<!--- Venues for Section 1 (from 2020 syllabus)
A topic presentation consists of studying in depth and presenting a
paper from a recent research conference in computer security, such as:

- ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security
- Network and Distributed System Security Symposium
- IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
- USENIX Security Symposium
--->

### Project

A project is an independent creative endeavor that results in an artifact. Various types of projects are acceptable provided they involve original thinking and new ideas. Projects are presented in class. A set of slides in Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint format should be submitted ahead of the presentation. A project report and a final version of the slides that incorporates feedback from the instructor and the class discussion should be submitted after the presentation. 

Examples of project types include:

- Analyze the security of a system, identifying vulnerabilities and developing attacks to exploit them
- Extend the results of a paper. This could be done in various ways such as:
    - Broaden applicability, improve performance, or incorporate recent technological advances or new laws and regulations
    - Build a proof-of-concept system prototype for a method described in a theoretical paper
    - Conduct surveys
    - Perform experiments on new datasets or to evaluate new metrics
- Develop interactive online learning materials for a computer security or privacy subject
- Conduct research on a new or insufficiently explored subject.

<!--- Other project types may be proposed. --->

## Participation

Attendance of every class and active participation in class discussions is required. Classes are generally not recorded to facilitate open exchange of diverse ideas and opinions and to encourage attention during class. 

Students with no more than one unexcused absence and who regularly contribute to in-class discussions will be given a perfect participation grade. 

## Expected Workload

During the semester, students will spend about 36 hours in lectures (3 hours per week), 60 hours on the topic presentation, and 90 hours on the project, for a total expected course workload of 186 hours.

## Late Policy, and Grading

Absences from class are excused and extensions are justified only for illness and personal or family emergencies. Each student is allowed one unexcused absence from class, unless the student is presenting that day. Please contact the instructors by email to request accommodations ahead of the missed class or due date.

Final numerical grades are determined by the instructor using the weights below:
* Project: 50%
* Topic presentation: 35%
* Participation: 15%

## Diversity and Inclusion

We intend for this course to provide a welcoming learning environment for all students. We especially welcome diverse ideas and perspectives during class discussions. However, despite our best efforts, we may accidentally slip up, so please feel free to speak to the instructors about your concerns. And in case you believe you need to escalate your concerns further, you can reach out to Professor Tom Doeppner (Vice Chair).

## Student Responsibilities

All Brown students are responsible for understanding and following the Brown Academic Code and Principles of the Brown University Community.

## Accessibility

Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Students who, by nature of a documented disability, require academic accommodations should contact the instructors. The staff of the office of Student and Employee Accessibility Services can be reached at  SEAS@brown.edu (or 401-863-9588) to discuss the process for requesting accommodations.
