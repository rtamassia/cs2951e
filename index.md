## Welcome to CSCI 2951-E

This course explores advanced topics and highlights current research
in computer security from a systems perspective. Topics include
applications security, cloud security, operating systems security,
software security, web security, and vulnerabilities and defenses in
cyber physical systems (e.g., automotive, medical, and industrial
control devices). Recent research papers will be presented and
discussed. Also, projects will provide an opportunity for creative
work such as investigating vulnerabilities, developing protocols,
building proof-of-concept prototypes, and making research
contributions.

[CSCI 1660](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs166/) or equivalent
background is essential.
Instructor permission required. 


## Course Work

The work for the course comprises a topic presentation, a project, and
participating in class discussions.

### Topic Presentation

A topic presentation consists of studying in depth and presenting a
paper from a recent research conference in computer security, such as:

- ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security
- Network and Distributed System Security Symposium
- IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
- USENIX Security Symposium

The presentation should include background material related to the paper
so it can be understood by everyone in the class.

### Project

A project is an independent creative endeavor that results in an artifact. Various types of projects are acceptable provided they involve original thinking and new ideas. Examples of project types include:

- Analyze the security of a system, identifying vulnerabilities and developing attacks to exploit them
- Improve on the results of a published research paper. This could be done in various ways such as:
- Extend the scope of a paper to broaden applicability, improve performance, or incorporate recent technological advances
- Build a proof-of-concept system prototype for a method described in a theoretical paper
- Perform additional experiments to expand the practical evaluation of an applied paper
- Develop interactive online learning materials for a computer systems security subject
- Conduct research on a new or insufficiently explored subject.
Other project types may be proposed.
