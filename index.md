## Welcome

This course explores advanced topics and highlights current research
in computer security from a systems perspective. Topics include
applications security, cloud security, operating systems security,
software security, web security, and vulnerabilities and defenses in
cyber physical systems (e.g., automotive, medical, and industrial
control devices). Recent research papers will be presented and
discussed. Also, projects will provide an opportunity for creative
work such as investigating vulnerabilities, developing protocols,
building proof-of-concept prototypes, and making research
contributions.

[CSCI 1660](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs166/) or equivalent
background is essential.
Instructor permission required.

The course can be used toward satisfying the
[capstone requirement](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/concentrating-in-cs/concentration-requirements/capstone/).

### Online Resources

This page serves as course syllabus and public website.

This  [Canvas website](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1083171),
accessible only by registered students, contains detailed course
information and materials, and is used to submit the deliverables for
the topic presentation and project.


## Learning Activities and Workload

The work for the course comprises a topic presentation, a project, and
participating in class discussions.

### Topic Presentation

A topic presentation consists of studying in depth and presenting a
paper from a recent research conference in computer security, such as:

- ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security
- Network and Distributed System Security Symposium
- IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
- USENIX Security Symposium

The presentation should include background material related to the paper
so it can be understood by everyone in the class.

### Project

A project is an independent creative endeavor that results in an artifact. Various types of projects are acceptable provided they involve original thinking and new ideas. Examples of project types include:

- Analyze the security of a system, identifying vulnerabilities and developing attacks to exploit them
- Improve on the results of a published research paper. This could be done in various ways such as:
    - Extend the scope of a paper to broaden applicability, improve performance, or incorporate recent technological advances
    - Build a proof-of-concept system prototype for a method described in a theoretical paper
    - Perform additional experiments to expand the evaluation component of an applied paper
- Develop interactive online learning materials for a computer systems security subject
- Conduct research on a new or insufficiently explored subject.

Other project types may be proposed.

### Expected Workload

During the semester, students will spend about 36 hours in lecture (3
hours per week), 60 hours on the topic presentation, and 90
hours on the project, for  a total expected course workload of 186
hours.


## Grading and Late Policy

Final numerical grades are determined using the weights below:
- Project: 55%
- Topic presentation: 35%
- Participation: 10%

Please contact Roberto by email if you need an extension.


## Diversity and Inclusion

We intend for this course to provide a welcoming learning environment for all
students. We especially welcome diverse ideas and perspectives during class
discussions. Indeed, viewing systems in different ways often results in more
robust and secure systems in the end.
However, despite our best efforts, we may accidentally slip
up, so please feel free to speak to any member of the course staff with any
concerns you have during the semester and do not hesitate to contact Roberto directly. He will take your concerns very seriously. And in case you believe you need to escalate your concerns further, you can  reach out to Professor Tom Doeppner (Vice Chair and Director of Undergraduate Studies).

## Student Responsibilities

All Brown students are responsible for understanding and following the
Brown Academic Code and Principles of the Brown University Community.

## Accessibility

Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all
students. Students who, by nature of a documented disability, require
academic accommodations should contact Roberto. The staff of the
office of Student and Employee Accessibility Services can be reached
at 401-863-9588 or `SEAS@brown.edu` to discuss the process for
requesting accommodations.
