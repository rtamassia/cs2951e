## Welcome to CS2951E

This course explores advanced topics and highlights current research in computer security from a systems perspective. Topics include applications security, cloud security, operating systems security, software security, web security, and vulnerabilities and defenses in cyber physical systems (e.g., automotive, medical, and industrial control devices). Recent research papers will be presented and discussed. Also, projects will provide an opportunity for creative work such as investigating vulnerabilities, developing protocols,  building proof-of-concept prototypes, and making research contributions.
